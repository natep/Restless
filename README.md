A type-safe HTTP client for iOS, inspired by Retrofit.

# Introduction

Restless turns your HTTP API into an Objective-C protocol.

Just define a protocol that inherits from `DRWebService`.

```objective-c
@protocol GitHubService <DRWebService>

@GET("/users/{user}/repos")
- (NSURLSessionDataTask*)listRepos:(NSString*)user
                          callback:DR_CALLBACK(NSArray<GitHubRepo*>*)callback;

@end
```

The `DRRestAdapter` class generates an implementation of the `GitHubService` protocol.

```objective-c
DRRestAdapter* ra = [DRRestAdapter restAdapterWithBlock:^(DRRestAdapterBuilder *builder) {
    builder.endPoint = [NSURL URLWithString:@"https://api.github.com"];
}];

NSObject<GitHubService>* service = [ra create:@protocol(GitHubService)];
```

Each `NSURLSessionTask` returned from the created `GitHubService` can make an asynchronous HTTP request to the remote webserver.

```objective-c
NSURLSessionDataTask* task = [service listRepos:@"natep"
                                       callback:^(NSArray<GitHubRepo*>* result,
                                                  NSURLResponse *response,
                                                  NSError *error)
{
    // response handling ...
}];
    
[task resume];
```

Use annotations to describe the HTTP request.

# API Declaration

Annotations on the interface methods and its parameters indicate how a request will be handled.

#### REQUEST METHOD

Every method must have an HTTP annotation that provides the request method and relative URL. There are six built-in annotations: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD and PATCH. The relative URL of the resource is specified in the annotation.

```objective-c
@GET("/users/list")
```

You can also specify query parameters in the URL.

```objective-c
@GET("/users/list?sort=desc")
```

#### URL MANIPULATION

A request URL can be updated dynamically using replacement blocks and parameters on the method. A replacement block is an alphanumeric string surrounded by { and }. The method will look for a parameter name that matches that string, and substitute in its value.

```objective-c
@GET("/users/{user}/repos")
- (NSURLSessionDataTask*)listRepos:(NSString*)user
                          callback:DR_CALLBACK(NSArray<GitHubRepo*>*)callback;
```

Any parameters to the method that are not otherwise consumed (for instance, used in a substitution) are included in the URL as a query item.

##### FormUrlEncoded

If you use the annotation `@FormUrlEncoded`, unused parameters will be included in the encoded body, instead of in the URL query.

#### REQUEST BODY

An object can be specified for use as an HTTP request body with a `@Body` method annotation containing the parameter name.

```objective-c
@POST("/users/new")
@Body("user")
- (NSURLSessionUploadTask*)createUser:(User*)user 
                             callback:DR_CALLBACK(User*)callback;
```

The object will also be converted using a converter specified on the `DRRestAdapter` instance. A JSON converter is used by default.

#### CALLBACK

`DR_CALLBACK()` is a special macro that takes the type of object that you want to be returned, and creates a `NSURLSessionTask`-style callback where the first callback parameter is an object of that type. In the `listRepos:callback:` example above, a callback type of `NSArray<GitHubRepo*>*` is specified. When you call the `listRepos:callback:` method, code completion will automatically expand that to the following callback:

```objective-c
^(NSArray<GitHubRepo*>* result, NSURLResponse *response, NSError *error)
```

The library will attempt to convert the response into the type of object you specified, using the converter that was specifed in the builder. In this case, an `NSArray` of `GitHubRepo` objects.

The callback should always be the last parameter of your method.

#### NSURLSessionTask

The return type of the method defines what type of `NSURLSessionTask` you want the method to build for you.

`NSURLSessionDataTask`, `NSURLSessionDownloadTask`, and `NSURLSessionUploadTask` are all supported, but you should make sure that the value you pass to `DR_CALLBACK()` is appropriate for the task. For instance, you should pass `NSURL*` when requesting an `NSURLSessionDownloadTask`. Upon completion that parameter of the callback will be a URL to a temporary file containing the download.

#### HEADER MANIPULATION

You can set static headers for a method using the `@Headers` annotation.

```objective-c
@Headers({ "Accept": "application/vnd.github.v3.full+json", "User-Agent": "Restless-Sample-App" })
@GET("/users/{username}")
- (NSURLSessionDataTask*)getUser:(NSString*)username
                        callback:DR_CALLBACK(User*)callback;
```

The value of the `@Headers` parameter should always be a JSON object (aka, a dictionary). The value of a header may also use parameter substitution.

#### AUTHENTICATION

For some authentication methods, you can simply assign a delegate to the `NSURLSession` that Restless uses, and implement `URLSession:didReceiveChallenge:completionHandler:`.

If you are using Basic or Digest Authentication, you can set that Authentication header for all requests in the session by providing it in the `NSURLSessionConfiguration`:

```objective-c
NSURLSessionConfiguration *sessionConfig = [NSURLSessionConfiguration defaultSessionConfiguration];
[sessionConfig setHTTPAdditionalHeaders:@{ @"Authorization": authHeader }];
NSURLSession *session = [NSURLSession sessionWithConfiguration:sessionConfig
                                                      delegate:nil
											     delegateQueue:nil];
```

#### LOGGING

If you want to log all network requests/responses, now you can with a new notification enhancement added to the framework. All you have to do is turn on *notificationEnabled* flag in the builder while creating the adapter. Example code has been updated to integrate with *AKANetworkLogging* logger pod.

```objective-c

DRRestAdapter* ra = [DRRestAdapter restAdapterWithBlock:^(DRRestAdapterBuilder *builder) {
builder.endPoint = [NSURL URLWithString:@"https://api.github.com"];
//for logger support
builder.notificationEnabled = YES;
}];

```
# Limitations

- Although this library is inspired by Retrofit, it does not yet have complete feature parity. In particular, multi-part encoded bodies are not natively supported yet.

- The current parsing logic does not handle multi-line annotations. So you cannot have a single annotation that spans multiple lines.

- The current parsing logic is primitive, and does not understand macros. So you should not use them in your web service protocol declaration. Typedefs may or may not work.

- Performance has not yet been evaluated. This will be a focus of future releases.

# Installation

It is recommended that you install this library via Cocoapods

```ruby
pod 'Restless'
```

After installation, you will need to add a new Run Script Build Phase to your project, that runs this command:

```bash
"${PODS_ROOT}"/Restless/Restless/Scripts/generate.sh
```
