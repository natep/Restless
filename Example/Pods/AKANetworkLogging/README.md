`AKANetworkLogging` is a framework for iOS network request logging of customizable verbosity, with support for outputting CURL.

## Usage

- To witness the full power of the logging check out `AKANetworkLogger.h`. This class is the pie, the rest is gravy.
- To easily integrate the logging with a network request framework that emits sensible notifications subclass `AKANetworkNotificationLogger`.
- To run the example project; clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first. Except for that won't help because I am still learning how to make the example work with Cocoapods.
- To run the tests umm... Tests are coming soon also.

## Installation

AKANetworkLogging is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org), to install
it simply add the following line to your Podfile:

    pod "AKANetworkLogging"
